# AE_ProMPS
The connector.py is a programm that uses YARP to communicate with a Matlab module present in this specific branch : https://github.com/misaki43/Multimodal-prediction-of-intention-with-ProMPs/tree/VTSFE.

By using this Matlab module with the current Python files, you can model, generate and recognize whole-body movements. Moreover you can predict the continuation of an initiate whole-body movement.

But to use this file, you have to read and adapt them, because all the Python module is not present there.
